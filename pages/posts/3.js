                    I find the most difficult part of change to be the rememberance of the initial commitment. 
                    On my path to self-improvement, I have seeked out many teachers of diverse backgrounds. 
                    One of the most effective teachers I have come across is a Vietnamese monk named Thich Nhat Hanh. 
                    He is a global spiritual leader, poet, and peace activist, second in fame to only the Dalai Lama.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                    The first book of his I read this summer was Peace is Every Step. In this book, Nhat Hanh does not only give spiritual guidance which has helped me be more at peace in every moment, but he tells the inspiring story of how he came to be who he is through meditation and insightful relationships. 
                    As a vastly respected buddhist in his later years, Nhat Hanh created a community to observe and support his values and lessons. 
                    This community is called Plum Villiage. He tells many stories of the people who live in this community with him.

                    This place is significant to me because out of it has come the most effective bell of attention that I have come across. My progress is strongly related to my ability to not stray from my path. To remind myself to be mindful in every moment, I can use keys that already exist in the world around me. For example, traffic is a very frustrating and difficult experience which we must all suffer through at some point. 
                    It is commong for someone in traffic to become angry at the divers around them. Angry at themselves for not leaving earlier. Angry at the government for not building bigger roads. But this suffering can all be avoided. 
                    Here is a gift I offer to you. Seek out every stop sign or red light you encounter on your drive. Instead of seeing it as a stop sign, see it as a bell to bring your self back into your body.

                    The past is already gone, and the future is not yet to come. We can be mindful in every moment and realize that all the requisites for happiness are inside ourselves. This mantra chant from the plum village serves as a beautiful reminder of these fundamental truths. I hope that you find value in them and allow them to enter your daily routine.

<p> The past has already gone, and the future has not yet come. </p>
<p> Let us not drown ourselves in regret for what has passed or </p>
<p> in expectations and worry for the future. </p>
<p> The Buddha has said that "we can be peaceful, happy, and free </p>
<p>in this present moment." (Bell) </p>
<p>Let us hear the Buddha's words and let go of our sadness and anxiety. </p>
<p>Let us come back to ourselves and </p>
<p>establish ourselves in what is present right now. </p>
<p>Let us learn to recognize the conditions for happiness </p>
<p>that are present within us and around us. </p>
<p>Can we hear the birds singing and the wind in the pines? </p>
<p>Can we see the green mountains, the white clouds, the golden moon? </p>
<p>The Pure Land is available in the present moment. </p>
<p>Every day we can enjoy ourselves in the Buddha Land. </p>
<p>Every mindful breath and step takes us to the Pure Land, </p>
<p>revealing all the wonders of the Dharma body. (Bell)</p>
<p>I am determined to let go of hurrying, competing, being busy and disgruntled. </p>
<p>I shall not run after fame, power, riches, and sex because I know that this does not lead to true happiness. </p>
<p>All it will bring me is misery and misfortune. (Bell) </p>
<p>I shall learn to know what is sufficient, to live simply, </p>
<p>so that I have time to live deeply every moment of my daily life, </p>
<p>giving my body and mind a chance to heal,and to have the time to look after and protect those I have vowed to love. </p>
<p>(Bell) </p>
<p>I shall practice for my mind to grow in love and compassion, </p>
<p>so that I have the ability to help beings anywhere </p>
<p>who are drowning in craving. (Bell) </p>
<p>I ask the Buddhas everywhere </p>
<p>to protect and guide me, </p>
<p>to support me on my path, </p>
<p>so that I can live in peace, joy, and freedom every day, </p>
<p>fulfilling the deepest aspiration as your disciple whom you trust and love. </p>
<p>(Bell, Bell) </p>
