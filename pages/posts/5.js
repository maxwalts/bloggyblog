                I love that movie. Will Smith and his kid hold a special place in my mind for making it what it was. There are a few lessons to be learned; the most important being the importance of finding virtues and holding on to them with an unbreakable grip.

Virtues, Socrates said, are the set of actions that are condusive to a happy life. These rules of life can become extremely complex, but there are a few simple powerful ones that make a great impact if they are sincerely adopted into one's life.

A good virtue should be a method to find the optimal intersection between chaos and order; the unpredictable and the expected; the spontaneous and the safe. Waking up early every morning, facing the challenges of life and rejecting avoidant behavior, and eating breakfast every morning are some good examples.

It is said that the majority of all medical patients could heal their own afflictions if they could only expel anxiety — the constricting, debilitating, and infectious affliction from which humanity increasingly suffers — from their lives. Such a great change is surprisingly straightforward. There are just a few virtues that could help the average person heal from most of the anxiety they feel throughout the day — all in a matter of 14 days.

Let's narrow it down to 3. Wake up at the same time every morning, and ensure that the time of day you are waking up to really is morning. Eat a fatty and substantial breakfast every morning. Compartmentalize every day so that you do not regret actions from past days or events upcoming in future days.

These are some ideas that come from Dale Carnegie in his writing, so these virtues have already stood the test of time.

The opposite of a virtue is a vice. Vices are the behaviors driven by chaos, impulse, and greed; conducive to suffering and failure. Vices may have to get their own post... there's a lot to get into there. There are many vices which I have picked up and learned to purge during my short 20 years here. I'd like to reflect on some of them — why I encountered them and how I left them behind in my path of self-improvement.
