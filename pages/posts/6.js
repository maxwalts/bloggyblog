                    It's hard to be a young adult today. I value my personal privacy greatly. This value makes me question my urge to keep a blog, podcast, or social media presence. I don't feel right about speaking so often when I know so little. I don't want to be a teacher — I just want to learn in public. And even so, I cringe thinking back at the things I said 6 months ago — a cycle that has repeated for years and will likely continue. It's hard to be a young adult today. </p>
<p>
I moved this week. Technically speaking — most of my belongings are still packed in my car waiting for me. It makes me think... a change of environment is a powerful opportunity. In a study in the 1990s, 90% of US Vietnam vets who were regular heroin users stopped use once they returned home. I'm no junkie, but some of my habits make me feel like one. As those veterans were triggered to use from the combat environment they interacted with, I was triggered to sleep poorly in an old bedroom that I used to do work and use my phone in. Remove the environment, remove the addiction — change your bedroom, change your life.

The blog so far, including this post, is purely exploratory. I'm writing until I encounter a topic that's good enough to focus on. A teacher once told me: the young and agile should use most of their time to explore; with more experience, more time should be dedicated to exploiting the best option yet found. Eventually, I will find myself in a routine where I explore with 20% of my hours, and exploit with the other 80%.

<p>

So, as this new stage of life begins... I renew my commitments. I will not let my time pass — I will take advantage of it. I will not be comfortable - I will be driven. I will not be proud - I will be humble. I will not be a teacher - I will be the student. I will not be isolated - I will be supportive. I will not be disorganized - I will be proactive.</p>
<p>

And one more thing... I will not update the blog sporadically... I will check in with you again next Wednesday ;) </p>
