                    Happy Wednesday!

                    Everyone has the potential to be a buddha. We say that all people have a buddha nature. In every person's unique journey, they will encounter much suffering and hardship.
                    The buddhas of all places and all times serve to support a single man in their path to enlightenment. No buddha is finished with their work until they have helped all who suffer reach enlightenment and peace.

                    <p>
                        This chant from the Plum Village is a display of the great respect we have for those who have realized their true Buddha nature, and ask for their assistance and guidance on our path to turn suffering into a joyful and fulfilling life.

                    <p>The Buddha is like the fresh full moon </p>
                    <p>that soars across the immense sky,</p>
                    <p>when the river of mind is truly calm </p>
                    <p>the deep waters perfectly mirror the radiance of the moon.</p>
                    <p>The countenance of the world honored one </p>
                    <p>like the full moon or the orb of the sun, </p>
                    <p>shines forth bright wisdomâ€™s halo, </p>
                    <p>embracing all with love, compassion, joy and inclusiveness.</p>
                        </p>

                    <p>
                    <p>May the Way of the Buddha grow ever more bright </p>
                    <p>and all beings receive the Dharma rain, </p>
                    <p>May compassion cool the flames of world, </p>
                    <p>and wisdom shine through the clouds of confusion </p>
                    <p>revealing to all the path.</p>

                    <p>May Mother Earth be protected and safe,</p>
                    <p>May the people in the world be equal and fee, </p>
                    <p>May the winds and the rains be in harmony,</p>
                    <p>May the land be at peace in all directions </p>
                    <p>and the people embrace the path.</p>

                    <p>just as for our very own family, </p>

                    <p>we aspire to follow all great beings.</p>
                    <p>With one heart we vow to practice </p>
                    <p>the way of all Bodhisattvas, of Samantabhadra </p>
